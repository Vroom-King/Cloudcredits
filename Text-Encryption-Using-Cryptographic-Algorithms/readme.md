Text Encryption Using Cryptographic Algorithms (AES – Fernet)

I’m excited to share a recent cybersecurity project where I developed a text encryption tool using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) implemented via Python’s cryptography library (Fernet).
🚀 Key Features:

    🔑 AES-128 encryption with HMAC for integrity

    💻 Secure key generation and storage

    🔐 Real-time text encryption and decryption via CLI

    ✅ User-friendly and educational for beginner infosec enthusiasts

This project deepened my understanding of data confidentiality, authenticated encryption, and the real-world importance of key management.
